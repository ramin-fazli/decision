**Decision** (https://decision.is) is a production-ready, AI-powered decision intelligence platform that transforms investment decision-making through advanced machine learning and quantitative analytics.

## üéì From Research to Reality

My journey began with completing a master's thesis titled *"The Impact of AI-powered Decision-Making on Venture Capital Investments"*. In that research, I implemented and evaluated four machine learning models (Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks, QDA) using Python and scikit-learn on Crunchbase data to predict startup success. The thesis employed empirical, data-driven methods and quantitative analysis to simulate AI-enhanced decision-making in venture capital.

Now, I've evolved that academic foundation into **Decision** - a robust, scalable SaaS platform that brings cutting-edge AI to investment professionals across multiple asset classes.

## üöÄ What is Decision?

Decision is an API-first investment intelligence platform that provides:

- **Predictive Analytics**: Advanced ML models for investment outcome prediction
- **Multi-Asset Support**: Extensible across VC, private equity, and public markets
- **Data Agnostic**: Seamless integration with any data source or format
- **Explainable AI**: Model transparency through SHAP and LIME integration
- **Real-time Intelligence**: Live monitoring and decision support

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Design Principles
- **API-First**: Our main interface is our API, flexibly integrating with any system
- **Cloud-Agnostic**: Runs on AWS, GCP, or Azure
- **Modular & Scalable**: Microservices architecture with independent scaling
- **Data Source Agnostic**: CSV, Excel, APIs, SQL/NoSQL databases supported

### Technology Stack

**Backend (Python)**
- FastAPI for high-performance API services
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch for ML/AI
- SQLAlchemy for database abstraction
- Celery for async task processing
- Redis for caching and message queuing

**Frontend (TypeScript)**
- Next.js 14 with React 18
- Tailwind CSS for modern styling
- Recharts for data visualization
- SWR for data fetching and caching

**Infrastructure**
- Docker & Docker Compose for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Terraform for Infrastructure as Code
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- PostgreSQL for primary data storage
- MinIO for object storage

**ML/AI Platform**
- Support for cloud ML services (Vertex AI, SageMaker, Azure ML)
- Local inference capabilities
- Model versioning and experiment tracking with MLflow
- Feature pipelines with Apache Airflow
